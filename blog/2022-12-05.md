- what I learned today: 
    - How to create basic .net VS project
    - CLR(common runtime language): manages execution of programs that can be written in different languages
    - IL(intermediate language) code: compiled at run time, other than that I might need a refresh on this
    - Entry point for .net appliation: http request

- what I would like to review:
    - A quick review of the CLR/IL information would be nice
    - In the past I have only used Git through powershell/git bash, do you have any thoughts on using the vs/vs code ui for git commands vs using a terminal?
